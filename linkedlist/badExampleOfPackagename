Another convention is that the package name is the base name of its source directory; the package in src/encoding/base64 is imported as "encoding/base64" but has name base64, not encoding_base64 and not encodingBase64.

In go, a convention is that a package's name should be equal to the name of its source directory.

single directory contains exactly one package.

in this case package name is singlylinkedlist but the directory name is linkedlist
